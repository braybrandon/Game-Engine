# MonoGame 2D Game Development Engine

> A modular 2D game engine built on **MonoGame** with a **Playground** app for rapid iteration.  
> Each engine area is a separate class library so games can consume only what they need.  
> Releases and changelogs are automated per-library with **Release Please**.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains a **modular 2D game engine** (Common, Engine, Graphics, Physics, IO, Content Pipeline, Tools) plus a **Playground** app used to iterate on features quickly.  
Each module is packaged and versioned independently, making it easy for games to depend on only the parts they need.

---

## ‚ú® Highlights

- Modular libraries with clear boundaries (Common, Engine, Graphics, Physics, IO, Content Pipeline, Tools)
- DesktopGL **Playground** project for rapid testing
- MGCB **Content Pipeline** helpers and importers
- Automated **monorepo releases** (component-scoped tags) and per-package publishing

## üõ† Requirements

- **.NET SDK 8.0**
- **MonoGame DesktopGL** (via NuGet in projects)
- **MGCB** (restored via `dotnet tool restore` or installed with MonoGame templates)
- Windows/macOS/Linux (desktop)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### Run from CLI

    # 1) Clone
    git clone https://github.com/braybrandon/Game-Engine.git
    cd Game-Engine

    # 2) Restore tools & packages
    dotnet tool restore
    dotnet restore

    # 3) Build everything
    dotnet build -c Release

    # 4) Run the Playground app
    dotnet run -c Release --project GameEnginePlayground/GameEnginePlayground.csproj

### Run from Visual Studio / Rider

1. Open the repo.  
2. Set **GameEnginePlayground** as the startup project.  
3. Build & run (F5).  
4. Use MGCB Editor as needed to build content.

---

## üì¶ Versioning & Releases

- Managed with **Release Please** (monorepo mode).  
- Tags are component-scoped (e.g., `engine@0.0.2`, `graphics@0.0.1`).  
- A package only releases when there are **releasable commits** in that path (see ‚ÄúCommit Messages‚Äù below).  
- Release artifacts are published to **GitHub Packages** per library (and optionally to NuGet.org if configured).

---

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow the guidelines below to keep history clean and releases predictable.

### 1) Branching

Use short, purposeful branch names:

- `feat/engine-targeting`
- `fix/graphics-spritebatch-leak`
- `docs/common-readme-pass`
- `chore/ci-release-please`

### 2) Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)

We **require** Conventional Commits so Release Please can cut versions and changelogs correctly.

Format

    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
    
    <body> (optional, wrap at ~100 cols)
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: <explanation> (optional)

Allowed types

- `feat` ‚Äì new feature ‚Üí **triggers release** (minor bump pre-1.0)
- `fix` ‚Äì bug fix ‚Üí **triggers release** (patch bump)
- `deps` ‚Äì dependency updates ‚Üí **triggers release** (patch)
- `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert` ‚Äì allowed, but **do not** trigger a release by themselves

Scopes (use the repo package/folder)

    common | engine | graphics | physics | io | contentpipeline | tools | playground | docs | ci

Good examples

    feat(engine): add data-driven TargetingSystem with Perception/Target components
    fix(graphics): prevent SpriteBatch dispose on device reset
    docs(docs): add architecture overview for physics module
    refactor(common): extract IEventBus to separate assembly
    build(ci): publish engine on component release

Breaking changes

    feat(engine): replace IWorld with IGameWorld
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: IWorld has been removed; use IGameWorld injected from DI.

One-off version override (rare)

    chore(engine): release
    
    Release-As: 0.1.1

Tips

- Squash merge PRs and set the **squash title** to a proper Conventional Commit.
- Keep PRs focused; include a short ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow‚Äù in the description.
- Add screenshots/GIFs for visual features (rendering/UI).

### 3) Local Packaging

To produce a local NuGet package for a library:

    dotnet pack GameEngine.Engine/GameEngine.Engine.csproj -c Release -o .nupkg

Consume locally by adding `.nupkg` as a NuGet source or by referencing the project directly.

---

## üß∞ Tooling

- **Husky** hooks live in `.husky/` (e.g., `commit-msg`). You can add a validator to enforce Conventional Commits.
- **Release Please** config lives in `.release-please-config.json` and per-package versions in `.release-please-manifest.json`.
